## Melbourne :: Compose Scala 3 Workshop
By Ben Hutchison & Ken Scambler

Over the last 16 years, Scala has become one of the most widely used FP languages, and has had a profound influence on newer languages like Swift, Kotlin and recent versions of Java and C#.

It is also about to receive a dramatic overhaul! Scala 3, due to be released next year, adds, modifies and deletes dozens of features currently in Scala 2. These aim to simplify common workflows, discourage bad practices, encourage good practices, and in some cases, are bold innovations. The current beta version is not yet production-level stable, but the feature set is expected to largely be the same for general release.

Let's learn it!

Whether you're a grizzled Scala veteran or new to Scala & FP, this workshop will help you get going with Scala 3, get familiar with the features and how to use them.
